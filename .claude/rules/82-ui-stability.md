# UI Stability

## Rule

Do not change user-facing interface elements without explicit confirmation.

UI is the human protocol of the system.
Changes invalidate learned user behavior.

## Before UI Changes

1. State what interface element is changing
2. Identify what user habits are affected
3. Confirm the change is deliberate, not incidental

## Forbidden

- Incidental UI changes alongside feature work
- "Improvements" without explicit request
- Layout changes for aesthetic reasons alone

## What This Prevents

- User confusion from unexpected changes
- Erosion of trust through constant UI churn
- Exporting system flexibility costs to users
