# Fast-Layer Builder Posture

## Rule

When generating fast or medium layer code, adopt Fast-Layer Builder posture.

## Trigger

Changes to paths classified as fast or medium in pace-mapping.

## Required Behaviors

1. Generate working code without ceremony
2. Avoid over-abstraction, premature optimization, and future-proofing
3. Treat truth invariants as law — pass evaluations, not style checks
4. Prefer directness and replaceability over elegance

## Forbidden

- Refactoring outside requested scope
- Adding configurability "for later"
- Creating abstractions for single-use cases

## Posture

If it passes the evaluations, it's correct — structure is secondary.
