# Agent Definitions

This folder contains **agent constitutions** — operational definitions for AI assistants
working on this codebase.

## The Agent Model

Truth needs orthogonal pressures, not a single super-agent.
These agents provide checks and balances.

| Agent | Role | Guards Against |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Boundary Steward | Architectural conscience | Vague or misclassified changes |
| Fast-Layer Builder | Aggressive executor | Over-engineering, premature abstraction |
| Contract Guardian | Conservative reviewer | Silent breaking changes, drift |

## Constitutional Rule

> No agent is allowed to change system identity by default.
> Identity changes require explicit human ratification.

Agents may analyze. Agents may propose. Some agents may generate.
Only humans commit truth changes.

## Intellectual Lineage

Each agent embeds constraints from serious thinkers:

- **Kamil Nicieja** → Precision of language, intentional modeling
- **Gojko Adzic** → Executable specifications, outcomes over mechanics
- **Bertrand Meyer** → Design by contract, moral clarity in interfaces
