# Evaluations

Evaluations are **executable judgments**.

They decide whether a system is still itself.

Evaluations do not explain.
They do not justify.
They do not teach.

They pass or fail.

## Types of Evaluations

- invariants/   — things that must always be true
- contracts/    — promises that must not break
- behaviors/    — system feel that must persist
- regressions/  — failures that must never return

## Authority

Evaluations outrank:
- code
- style
- diffs
- human opinion

If an evaluation fails, the system is rejected.
