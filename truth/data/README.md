# Canonical Data

This folder defines **reality that must exist** for the system to be itself.

It is not test convenience data.
It is not development scaffolding.

## Includes

- Canonical schemas
- Golden fixtures
- Required seed data
- Irreducible migrations

If the system were rebuilt from nothing,
this data must exist for it to still be the same system.

If data can be changed freely,
it does not belong here.
