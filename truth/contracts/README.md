# Contracts

Contracts define **external promises**.

They describe what others are allowed to rely on,
regardless of internal implementation.

## Contracts Are For:

- Users
- Integrators
- Downstream systems
- Future implementations

## Contracts Are NOT For:

- Internal structure
- Optimization details
- Private behavior
- Implementation shortcuts

If someone depends on it and it changes,
the system has broken trust.

That belongs here.
