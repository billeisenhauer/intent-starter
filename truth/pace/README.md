# Pace

This folder defines **permission to change**, not advice on how to work.

Pace exists to prevent accidental erosion of system identity.

## Purpose

Pace answers:
- What may change freely?
- What requires review?
- What must change rarely and deliberately?

## Important Distinction

Pace does NOT say:
- how fast you should work
- how important something feels

Pace says:
- what level of ceremony is required to change something

If pace begins to describe process,
it is contaminated.
