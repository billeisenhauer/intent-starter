# Intent

This folder defines **what the system is**.

Intent answers questions like:
- What problem does this system exist to solve?
- What must it never become?
- What rules define its legitimacy?
- What outcomes must users always observe?

Intent is **normative**, not descriptive.

## Allowed Content

- Declarative statements
- Absolute language ("must", "must not")
- User-observable outcomes
- Business rules that define legitimacy

## Forbidden Content

- Implementation details
- Framework references
- Procedural plans
- Speculation ("for now", "eventually", "maybe")

If a statement cannot be evaluated against a running system,
it does not belong here.
