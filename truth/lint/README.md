# Truth Lint

Truth lint detects **category errors**.

It does not validate correctness.
It validates purity.

If lint fails, truth has been contaminated.

## What Lint Catches

- Framework references
- Application paths
- Procedural language
- Speculative language
- TODOs and placeholders
- Implementation leakage

Truth must be explicit, normative, and executable.

Anything else is a breach.
